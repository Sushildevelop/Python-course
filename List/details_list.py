# List

# Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

# Why do we use Lists?

# Instead of creating many variables like:

# a = 10
# b = 20
# c = 30

# We can store everything in one place:

# numbers = [10, 20, 30]



# Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data,
# the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

# Lists are created using square brackets. []


# List Items

# List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

# List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.


#Ordered - When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order,
# and that order will not change unless we specifically change it.


#Changeable -  Lists are changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.


# Allow Duplicates - Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value.
